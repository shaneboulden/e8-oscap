# e8-oscap

This repository is no longer maintained - the Essential 8 profiles for Red Hat Enterprise Linux are now available at the [ComplianceAsCode](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content) project.

There's direct links to the Essential profiles for RHEL7 and RHEL8 here:
* [RHEL7](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/rhel7/profiles/e8.profile)
* [RHEL8](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/rhel8/profiles/e8.profile)

You can also build the SCAP content and Ansible playbooks directly from the ComplianceAsCode project:
```
git clone https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content
cd content
./build_product rhel8
```
